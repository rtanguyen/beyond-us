# BEYOND-US

## Description

A react based application built to connect remarkable humans to extraordinary organizations with one goal in mind, to help those beyond ourselves. Beyond Us brings forth real world issues that require your help today.

Our development team wanted a platform where we can throw all the politics aside and talk about what really matters. Where we as devs, content creators, and users alike can share our voice on topics that need more highlighting in the media.

Climate change, women's rights, poverty, animal cruelty, and more. These issues we face are affecting people around the world and future generations to come if we don't start to make a change. Our platform provides access to hundreds of non-profits and volunteer organizations in defense of the greater good. Together we can make waves that can impact lives and change the world.
